### With the new ChatGPT and Whisper api out I wanted to work on some projects to practice how to use it and make tools with ai.  
  
I'm sure I'll be adding to these and updating things as they come along.  
  
Pretty wild we can do things like this.  
  
  
  # To Run  
  1) Create a config.py  
  2) put your OpenAI api key in as OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key".  
  3) Run:
    
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements
